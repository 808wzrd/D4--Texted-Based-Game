Synopsis
Your character seeks refuge in an old, secluded mansion after their car breaks down a mile or so down the road. The gates and front door are open but there is no sign of the owners anywhere. There is a parked police cruiser in the courtyard. Your phone dies moments after the mechanic tells you that no one will be able to get to your vehicle until morning. You decide to stay in the mansion until morning. It is raining heavily and there is thunder and lightning. You begin to search the house for the owner when you discover the corpse of a local police officer. You pick up his firearm and look around for clues as to what happened to him when the deceased officer stands up and starts trudging towards you. This is where the first fight occurs. You attack the zombie and either die which results in game over, or you kill the zombie and proceed through the house. You continue to find more zombies throughout the house and on your journey you locate healing items and new weapons to help you in your fight for survival. You make your way to the master bedroom and find the owner who is more dangerous than regular zombies and acts as the final boss. You proceed to fight the owner and either win and survive your stay in the mansion, or you die which again results in game over.
